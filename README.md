# Depth first search

### The depth first search algorithm to traverse graphs
### here are the recursive and the iterative version
### there are two graphs, one is directed and the other undirected
### both represented with an adjacency list using a Map (the javascript Map object)
### there are two modes, full traverse, and search a specific node.
### the algorithm returns the traversed path
